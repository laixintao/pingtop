    A pure python ping implementation using raw socket.


    Note that ICMP messages can only be sent from processes running as root.


    Derived from ping.c distributed in Linux's netkit. That code is

    That code is in turn derived from code written by Mike Muuss of the
    US Army Ballistic Research Laboratory in December, 1983 and
    placed in the public domain. They have my thanks.

    Bugs are naturally mine. I'd be glad to hear about them. There are
    certainly word - size dependenceies here.

    Revision history
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    November 22, 1997
    -----------------
    Initial hack. Doesn't do much, but rather than try to guess
    what features I (or others) will want in the future, I've only
    put in what I need now.

    December 16, 1997
    -----------------
    For some reason, the checksum bytes are in the wrong order when
    this is run under Solaris 2.X for SPARC but it works right under
    Linux x86. Since I don't know just what's wrong, I'll swap the
    bytes always and then do an htons().

    December 4, 2000
    ----------------
    Changed the struct.pack() calls to pack the checksum and ID as
    unsigned. My thanks to Jerome Poincheval for the fix.

    May 30, 2007
    ------------
    little rewrite by Jens Diemer:
     -  change socket asterisk import to a normal import
     -  replace time.time() with time.clock()
     -  delete "return None" (or change to "return" only)
     -  in checksum() rename "str" to "source_string"

    November 8, 2009
    ----------------
    Improved compatibility with GNU/Linux systems.

    Fixes by:
     * George Notaras -- http://www.g-loaded.eu
    Reported by:
     * Chris Hallman -- http://cdhallman.blogspot.com

    Changes in this release:
     - Re-use time.time() instead of time.clock(). The 2007 implementation
       worked only under Microsoft Windows. Failed on GNU/Linux.
       time.clock() behaves differently under the two OSes[1].

    September 25, 2010
    ------------------
    Little modifications by Georgi Kolev:
     -  Added quiet_ping function.
     -  returns percent lost packages, max round trip time, avrg round trip
        time
     -  Added packet size to verbose_ping & quiet_ping functions.
     -  Bump up version to 0.2

    April, 2019
    -----------
    Forked by laixintao:
    - Migrate to Python3
    - Make it thread safe by setting a flag in packet
    - do not need sudo (by @gzxultra (Zhixiang) )
